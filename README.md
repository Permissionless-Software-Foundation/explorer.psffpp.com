# bch-wallet-web3-spa

This is a web-based single page app (SPA) written in React. It provides non-custodial wallet features for the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, including support for SLP tokens and NFTs.

The code repository is the successor to [bch-wallet-web-android](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-wallet-web3-android). It is forked from [react-bootstrap-web3-spa](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/react-bootstrap-web3-spa), and any updates to that upstream repository are pulled into this repository. The individual wallet components from bch-wallet-web-android have been audited, refactored, and ported to this repository. It a complete rewrite of the original codebase.

This code repository is intended to be a boilerplate for creating creative BCH-based web apps. It is built on top of the [Cash Stack](https://cashstack.info) web3 architecture, which provides a censorship-resistant back-end for accessing the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.
