# explorer.psffpp.com

The primary purpose of this app is to provide uploading, downloading, and file exploration tools for the [PSFFPP](https://psffpp.com) decentralized file sharing network.

This is a web-based single page app (SPA) written in React. It provides non-custodial wallet features for the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, including support for SLP tokens and NFTs. It is forked from [bch-wallet-web-spa](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-wallet-web3-spa), and any updates to that upstream repository are pulled into this repository.

On top of that base, are features and screens for interacting with the PSFFPP network.

## Installation
